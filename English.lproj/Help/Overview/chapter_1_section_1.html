<h1><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial" color="#330099">otx
Help</font></h1>
<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">otx
stands for "object tool extended". otx uses otool(object tool) to
disassemble a Mach-O executable file, then enhances the disassembled
output. Simple enhancements include adding the machine code of each
instruction as well as the offset of each instruction from the
beginning of a function. More complicated enhancements include
displaying the names of ObjC methods even if symbols have been
stripped, and adding comments that describe member variables, function
calls, static data and more. </font></p>

	<p align="center"><img src="../images/MainWindow.jpg"></p>

<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">otx can open almost
any Mach-O executable file you're likely to use- PPC or x86, single
architecture or universal binary. When you open a universal binary, the
popup menu show above allows you to select which architecture to
disassemble. If you have lipo installed, you can easily separate the
selected architecture using the "Thin" button.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">If you have obfuscated
your code, you may find that otool's disassembly is less than desirable.
To assist you, otx includes a very basic deobfuscator. By using the
"Verify" button shown above, you can verify that otool will be able to
correctly disassemble your executable. If this verification fails, otx
will ask if you would like to save a deobfuscated copy of your executable.
Should you choose to do so, the deobfuscated copy will be automatically
opened for further processing. Currently, deobfuscation is only necessary
for x86 executables.</p>
